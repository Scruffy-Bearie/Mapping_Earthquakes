# Using Mapbox and GeoJSON Data From the United States Geological Survey (USGS) to Create Interactive Maps of Recent Earthquakes

## Overview
Using a map to display data related to geographical data or events can, in many circumstances, be a more powerful analytical tool than more traditional numeric methods.  Mapbox is the creator of, or major contributor to, mapping libraries and applications which when combined with GeoJSON files allow for the creation of interactive, analytically powerful maps.  The purpose of this investigation was to use Mapbox applications in conjunction with GeoJSON data from the USGS to produce a map displaying global earthquake data from the past 7 days which provided the user to select different base map designs and tile layers.

## Results
The map produced loads with the “Streets” base layer selected and all three tile layers (Earthquakes, Tectonic Plates and Major Earthquakes) displayed (See Figure 1).

The map was produced such that once loaded, it was possible for the user to select between three different base layers (Streets, Satellite and Dark) to suit their viewing preferences (See Figure 2).

Moreover, additional programming was performed so that it was possible for the user to select/deselect available tile layers (Earthquakes, Tectonic Plates and Major Earthquakes) in addition to the Base Layer of their choice (See Figure 3).

Finally, select earthquake data (magnitude and location) was bound to a “click activated” pop up window associated with each individual earthquake and the map equipped with a “zoom” feature such that used could isolate (zoom in on) a specific geological event and view additional information (See Figure 4).

## Summary
Although the map produced meets the specified requirements of the investigation, it is possible that a more dramatic/visually enticing product could  have been produced using “pay for” base layers (as apposed to those available without charge) and different color schemes.
